### 🧠 Replit Prompt: People Data Labs Enrichment with Phone Priority

> Extend REVA’s lead enrichment to use **People Data Labs (PDL)**, prioritizing **phone numbers** over emails for the top 3 AI-generated leads.
>
> ### API Info:
>
> * Endpoint: `https://api.peopledatalabs.com/v5/person/enrich`
> * Method: `POST`
> * Headers:
>
>   * `"Content-Type": "application/json"`
>   * `"X-Api-Key": "123b65594c503adece995b077f09be659a6972e78c55382cca39af59af540746"`
>
> ### Request Body Format:
>
> ```json
> {
>   "email": "sarah.johnson@brightco.com",
>   "min_likelihood": 0.7
> }
> ```
>
> ### Requirements:
>
> 1. **For the top 3 leads**, after generating them:
>
>    * Use their **email** (enriched via Hunter.io) as the input to PDL
>    * Call the `person/enrich` endpoint
>    * Extract and display the following (if available):
>
>      * **Phone number** (prioritize this as the primary contact method)
>      * **Full name** (if more complete than the AI-generated one)
>      * **Title** (e.g., “Marketing Director”)
>      * **LinkedIn URL**
> 2. **Display logic per lead card**:
>
>    * Show the **phone number first**, with a phone icon and copy button
>    * Show the email (below phone)
>    * Show name/title (replacing AI-generated name if PDL returns a better one)
>    * Show LinkedIn icon linking to profile (if present)
> 3. **Fallback logic**:
>
>    * If no phone is returned, keep email as primary contact
>    * If PDL returns no data at all, retain AI-generated info
> 4. Log full enrichment response to the console for debugging
> 5. API key can be stored in `.env`, or hardcoded just for testing the MVP

This will give REVA the power to surface **direct, high-value contacts** — crucial for brokers and leasing reps who need faster outreach cycles.

Let me know if you want a follow-up step to:

* Cache enrichment data to avoid repeated API calls
* Rank leads with phones above others
* Add visual indicators (e.g., “📞 Direct Contact Available”)
