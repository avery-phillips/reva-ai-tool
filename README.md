- **Input Validation**: Server-side validation with express-validator and Zod
- **Security Headers**: Comprehensive security headers with Helmet
- **API Key Management**: Environment variables for sensitive data
- **Error Handling**: Secure error responses without sensitive information exposure
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper CORS setup for production and development

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- PostgreSQL database (Neon Serverless recommended)
- People Data Labs API key

### Environment Variables
The following environment variables are required:

```
DATABASE_URL=your_postgresql_connection_string
PDL_API_KEY=your_people_data_labs_api_key
SESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret_key
```

### Installation

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Set up your environment variables in Replit Secrets or `.env` file

3. Push the database schema:
```bash
npm run db:push
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### Production Build

1. Build the application:
```bash
npm run build
```

2. Start the production server:
```bash
npm run start
```

## API Endpoints

### Lead Management
- `POST /api/leads` - Create and enrich new leads
- `GET /api/leads` - Retrieve all leads with pagination
- `GET /api/health` - Health check and performance metrics

### Rate Limits
- **General API**: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
- **Lead Generation**: 5 requests per minute per IP (resource-intensive)
- **Slow Down**: Progressive delays after 10 requests per 15 minutes

## Database Schema

### Leads Table
- Primary identifiers and business information
- PDL enrichment fields (phone, enrichedName, title)
- Timestamps and enrichment status flags
- Optimized indexes for common queries

### Performance Optimizations
- Database indexes on commonly queried fields
- In-memory caching for PDL API responses
- Request monitoring and metrics collection
- Pagination for large datasets

## Security Measures

### Input Validation
- Server-side validation for all input fields
- Email format validation before API calls
- URL validation for website and LinkedIn URLs
- Length limits and content sanitization

### API Security
- Rate limiting on all endpoints
- CORS configuration for allowed origins
- Content Security Policy headers
- Request size limits to prevent DoS attacks

### Data Protection
- API keys stored in environment variables
- Secure error handling without information leakage
- Password requirements for future authentication features
- JWT token-based authentication ready

## Monitoring and Performance

### Health Monitoring
- Real-time performance metrics
- Error rate tracking
- Slow request detection and logging
- Memory usage monitoring

### Caching Strategy
- PDL API responses cached for 1 hour (successful)
- Negative results cached for 30 minutes
- Automatic cache cleanup every 10 minutes
- Cache statistics and monitoring

## Development Guidelines

### Code Quality
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- Comprehensive error handling
- Clean separation of concerns
- Consistent naming conventions
- Detailed code comments

### Best Practices
- Environment-based configuration
- Proper logging without sensitive data exposure
- Modular architecture with middleware
- Type safety throughout the stack
- Security-first development approach
